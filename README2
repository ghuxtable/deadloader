##### This file contain my own instructions/steps I followed to download mp3's from URLs. ####

This program automates the download of an entire set of mp3's.

## Breakdown of how this program works

# Verbal Flow Diagram

This script seeks out one .m3u file that is the playlist for the particular show.

1. The goal of the first line is to manipulate the input url 
"$1" is where the input URL is placed.  the cut command, using the -d \/ and -f flags, removes the first few strings occuring before "/".

# Bash Variables

$1 is the first (and only in this case) call sign for the argument given to the executable script, and it
is the .m3u URL

## Instructions for downloading a single song/mp3 from archive.org:

1. On archive.org/... where the show is that you want to download (i.e. the page you would play music from), right click anywhere and "inspect element."
2. Search for the string "mp3" (perhpas one day mp4?) to find the URL to the first song that looks something like the following
https://archive.org/download/gd76-07-17.sbd.unknown.243.sbeok.shnf/gd76-07-17d1t01.mp3

2b. I had to install the homebrew version of 'wget' since curl alone was not working to download .mp3 files
  brew install wget
  
2d. Also, had to update Xcode from 10 to 11.3.1 (the latest stable version for Mojave), and similarly Command Line Tools for Xcode
  rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  Moved /Applications/Xcode to trash and emptied trash.
  
2c. Went to developer.apple.com to download the latest stable version of Xcode for Mojave (11.3.1), as well as the respective version of Command Line 
Tools for Xcode
  Downloaded and installed Xcode 11.3.1 .xip and the respective Command Line Tools .dmg
  Command Line Tools is stored in /Library/Developers
  Xcode is in /Applications
  
3. Next you must download the mp3 linked to the URL, by using using the curl command in the terminal:
  curl https://archive.org/download/gd76-07-17.sbd.unknown.243.sbeok.shnf/gd76-07-17d1t01.mp3

***or try:
  curl [URL] -o [outfile]
    This created and empty outfile in the directory it ran...
    File was empty.

4. Tried wget method and IT WORKED
  Attempt 1: wget [URL]
  
5. Download a file conating the URL to all songs in the playlist. Returns a .m3u file.
  wget https://archive.org/download...m3u
