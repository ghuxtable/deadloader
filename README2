Instructions for downloading a single song/mp3 from archive.org:

1. On archive.org/... where the show is that you want to download (i.e. the page you would play music from), right click anywhere and "inspect element."
2. Search for the string "mp3" (perhpas one day mp4?) to find the URL to the first song that looks something like the following
https://archive.org/download/gd76-07-17.sbd.unknown.243.sbeok.shnf/gd76-07-17d1t01.mp3

2b. I had to install the homebrew version of 'wget' since curl alone was not working to download .mp3 files
  brew install wget
  
2c. Went to developer.apple.com to download the latest stable version of Xcode for Mojave (11.3.1), as well as the respective version of Command Line 
Tools for Xcode
2d. Also, had to update Xcode from 10 to 11.3, and similarly Command Line Tools for Xcode
  rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  
3. Next you must download the mp3 linked to the URL, by using using the curl command in the terminal:
  curl https://archive.org/download/gd76-07-17.sbd.unknown.243.sbeok.shnf/gd76-07-17d1t01.mp3

***or try:
  curl [URL] -o [outfile]
    This created and empty outfile in the directory it ran...
